# Creating Living Documentation with Odoo and Behave
This repo contains demo code that accompanies my talk at Odoo Experience 2015. To run the example you'll need to add my
[fork of Behave](https://github.com/Gimpneek/behave "My Fork of Behave") (pull request on it's way) and run Behave from the repo folder like you would normally with OERPScenario.

`behave --living-doc --living-doc-directory=living_doc --living-doc-meta=config.json /path/to/features/`
